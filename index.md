The Generlate handbook describes how we (Generlate teammates) work. It’s publicly visibly because we are an [open company](company/index.md#open-company).

The handbook is a living document and we expect every teammate to propose improvements, changes, additions, and fixes to keep it continuously up-to-date and accurate.

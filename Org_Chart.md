How to edit

This org chart is generated automatically based on the contents of other handbook pages.

    1. To add a team, edit this page and add a link to the section of the team's page that lists the members
         (such as ### [My team](../../myteam/index.md#members)).
    2. To edit a team, edit the linked section on the team's page. In the example above, you'd edit the
         Members section of ../../myteam/index.md. Everything in that section until the next heading is displayed
         on this page.
    3. To add any other text or structure to this page, just insert it as you would normally. Only 3rd-level
         heading links (lines that start with ### and that have a link) are treated specially; all other content is
         preserved.

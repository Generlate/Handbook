Generlate is a generative tool for architecture design, on windows.

---

# Getting Started

Visual Studio 2019 is recommended, Generlate is untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

1. Downloading the repository
   start by cloning the repository with git clone --recursive https://github.com/Generlate/Generlate.  
   If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use git submodule update --init to clone the necessary submodules.

2. Configuring the dependencies

## The Plan

The plan for Generlate is to create an innovative tool that will automate the majority of processes included in modern building design. Development of the application is published on Youtube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQFeRy_NDvUsA0VmuJNBUYQ

# Main Features To Come

-   ML image generator
-   ML model generator
-   Trait optomizer
-   Object recognition
-   Metaverse Integration
-   Export to common architecture file types: .ai, .ps, .3dm, .dwg, etc.
-   Integrated libraries to replace field experts
-   visual scripting

# Short Term Goals

Roadmap at [Roadmap](Roadmap.md)

We would like to have a proof of concept by 2023. This will probably include a basic ML algorithm, which can produce editable models.

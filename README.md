Generlate is a generative tool for architecture design, on windows.

---

# Getting Started

Visual Studio 2019 is recommended, Generlate is untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

1. Downloading the repository
   start by cloning the repository with git clone --recursive https://github.com/Generlate/Generlate.  
   If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use git submodule update --init to clone the necessary submodules.

2. Configuring the dependencies

## The Plan

The plan for Generlate is to create a tool that will automate the majority of processes included in modern building design. Development of the application is published on Youtube at http://www.youtube.com/@generlate/videos

# Short Term Goals

Roadmap at [Roadmap](Roadmap.md)

We would like to have a proof of concept by 2026. This will probably include a basic ML algorithm, which can produce editable models.

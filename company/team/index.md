-   I have always been interested in the way people interact with technology. My attention is currently
    directed toward furthering the distribution of artificial intelligence to the construction, architecture
    and landscape architecture industries. My AI-driven application, titled Ilblu, is a medium for
    environment/building design; a higher efficiency program that synthesizes existing schemes to
    produce optimal environment/building proposals. You could think of it like generative design, but on
    steroids. By increasing efficiency in every industry, my hope is that humanity can progress beyond an
    economy driven society!

    Aside from Generlate, architecture, transhumanism, politics, fitness, anime, creating a metadata abstractor,
    additive manufacturing, automation, VR/AR, neuralink, modular capability, quantum computing,
    non-Euclidean geometry and hive minds are all interests of mine.
